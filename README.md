Django is an open-source python web framework used for rapid development, pragmatic, maintainable, clean design, and secures websites. A web application framework is a toolkit of all components need for application development. The main goal of the Django framework is to allow developers to focus on components of the application that are new instead of spending time on already developed components. Django is fully featured than many other frameworks on the market. It takes care of a lot of hassle involved in the web development; enables users to focus on developing components needed for their application.

step1- Create an Project using Command:
 $ django-admin startproject (projectname)

  They create an directory name as project name. In projectname folder there are few files are created that is 
  . __init_.py
  . setting.py
  . urls.py
  . wsgi.py
  . manage.py

  From all for these files two files are main and mostly used in this project that is 
  . urls.py
  . setting.py
  . manage.py

Step2:-  Run the server . To run the server we have to stay in the same directory and run the command:

$ py manage.py runserver

After this execution, it show's a utls and that url shows  the django successfully working web page.


Step3:- Create an app for our Project. In django project app is used to provide the functionality to our webpages. how link works 

$ py manage.py startapp appname

After Creating an app folder first thing is to do is add app name in the project setting.py folder under INSTALLED APPS section.

In django,build in sqlite database that store all data in the admin panel.

I have also shared the screenshots for the same.
